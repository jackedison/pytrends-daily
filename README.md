<h1>Pytrends-daily</h1>

This package began as a fork of [gtrends](https://github.com/ecsalina/gtrends) which adds normalised, daily data pulls to the [pytrends](https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends) API for google trends.

I have begun adding my own custom features and corrected some bugs in the original code.

There is still a slight discrepency in overlapping vs daily data pull methods which results in a ~10% error.
